# Students-Academic-Results-Prediction
The Students' Academic Result Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast student graduation and dropout rates. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes demographic, socioeconomic, and academic performance data, the project aims to identify students at risk of academic failure. We utilize various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to achieve this goal. Our models achieved a notable accuracy of 91.64% with Logistic Regression.

##Abstract
Predicting student academic outcomes is essential for enhancing educational institutions' ability to support at-risk students. This project develops a predictive model to forecast student graduation and dropout rates using machine learning. By analyzing demographic and academic data, we aim to identify students who may need additional support. The Logistic Regression model provided the highest accuracy, indicating its effectiveness in classifying student outcomes.

##Problem Statement
Educational institutions often struggle with retaining students and ensuring their academic success. This project explores the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to predict student dropout and graduation rates. The goal is to identify at-risk students early, allowing institutions to implement targeted interventions and improve overall student outcomes.

##Approach
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   * Dataset: Contains over 4,400 records with 34 attributes, including demographic, socioeconomic, and academic data.
   * Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Graphviz.
   * Techniques: Data cleaning, numerical encoding of categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   * Visualized data distributions and relationships using plots and charts.
   * Identified key factors influencing student success and dropout rates.
3. Modeling:
   * Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
   * Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.
4. Results:
   * Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (91.64%), followed by SVM (91%) and Decision Tree (90%).
   * Grid Search optimization improved the classification accuracy of all models by an average of 0.7%.

##Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of machine learning in predicting student academic outcomes. The models developed provide valuable insights into factors affecting student success and dropout rates. The Logistic Regression model, in particular, demonstrates high accuracy, making it a useful tool for educational institutions to identify and support at-risk students effectively.
